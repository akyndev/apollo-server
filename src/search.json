The Internet systematizes, amplifies, focuses, fully resources, funds, schedules, plans and implements high production value \u003cem\u003efoo\u003c/em\u003elery.  Corporate drone: \u0026quot;Larry, Sergey, have you signed off yet on this years $4M April \u003cem\u003eFoo\u003c/em\u003els budget? How are we going to attract and recruit the best engineers unless we've got a reputation for the very best and most \u003cem\u003efoo\u003c/em\u003elish April \u003cem\u003eFoo\u003c/em\u003els trickery?\u0026quot; Ugh.\u003cp\u003eIt's just kind of silly and boring and makes we wish April 2 would come as soon as possible. As I read the Internet on April 1 I just try to self filter out all the silly unbelievable garbage. Most news sites (including HN) are hardly worth reading April 1.\u003cp\u003eYou know when someone who thinks they are funny insists on telling lame jokes, and the audience feels an obligation to give an acknowledging guffaw? It's like an whole Internet day worth of that.\u003cp\u003eI feel like the Grinch Who Stole April \u003cem\u003eFoo\u003c/em\u003els but really it has to be said.  If you've got it in mind to do some fine ol' \u003cem\u003efoo\u003c/em\u003elin then maybe the classy thing to do is leave the \u003cem\u003efoo\u003c/em\u003elin to others and spare us one more depressingly lame absurdity.",
